### Time series classification
Implementation of Time Series Classification from Scratch with Deep Neural Networks: A Strong Baseline (2016, arXiv) in Pytorch by using a skorch wrapper. Initially, we experimented with the implementation of all 3models explored in the paper in keras (trclassification_keras) and then completed the assignment implementing the Fully Convolutional Network (ConvNet) in Pytorch. 
The private class is under /src along with code for downloading datasets. The parent folder includes a notebook implementing the time-series classification problem with skorch wrapper and a unit test that passes the test :)
